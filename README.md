# hushApp

## Synopsis

This is the project of a mobile app (made in Ionic for both Android/iPhone) for reading text-only, "stripped" versions of newspapers, already recovered and made available on a server in a JSON version. Right now we are working on "El Carabobeño", a venezuelan diary whose printed version was recently choked and dissapeared thanks to venezuelan government (dis)information policies.

## Motivation

We are motivated by recent informational events in politically unstable countries, where things such as: 

- slow Internet services,
- bad territorial coverage of mobile data services,
- politically-planned deterrences to printed newspapers and material sources of information,
- state policies monopolizing national networks and blocking sources of online news, 

Prevents people from reaching up to date information about things happening in their countries, or sometimes even in their own neighbourhoods.

This app also responds to recent trends gazing towards going back to "real text" as an important type of Internet content, in times when immediacy (Twets, pictures or videos) is putting under question the real value of what we share online.

Let's see what we can do about that...
